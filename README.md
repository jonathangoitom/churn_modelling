# Customer Churn Modelling using Artificial Neural Networks

This project uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to model customer churn in a telecommunications company. The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as demographics, usage patterns, and account information, as well as whether or not the customer has churned.

## Introduction 
Customer churn is a major concern for companies in industries such as telecommunications, where competition is high and customers have many options to choose from. The goal of this project is to develop an ANN model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn. The dataset used in this project is from a telecommunications company and contains various customer attributes such as account information, demographic data, and usage patterns.
